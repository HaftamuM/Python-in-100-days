# Project 1 : Band Name Generator 
Beginner Challange :
The Band Name Generator is a Python program that utilizes lists, random number generation, and string concatenation to create and display a unique band name by selecting random adjectives and nouns.

# Project 2 : Tip Calculator
Beginner Challange : 
The Tip Calculator is a Python program employing user input, mathematical operations, and formatted output to calculate and display the tip amount based on a bill and user-specified tip percentage.

# Project 3 : Treasure Island
Beginner Challange : 
The Treasure Island Python program utilizes control flow structures and logical operators to create a text-based adventure game, where user decisions determine the outcome of the story, leading to either success or failure.

# Project 5  : Password Generator
Beginner Challange : 
The Password Generator is a Python program that employs string manipulation and randomization to generate secure and randomized passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length and inclusion of various character types.

# Project 6  : Escaping the maze
The "Escaping the Maze" game in Python generates a random maze with walls and open paths, featuring a start and exit point. Players navigate through the maze using keyboard inputs to reach the exit while avoiding obstacles, offering a simple yet interactive gaming experience.

To experience the "Escaping the Maze" scenario on the Reeborg's World website using Python, follow these steps:

- Open the following link in a web browser: Reeborg's World Maze Scenario.
- Once the page is loaded, switch to the "Python code" tab on the left side of the page.
- Copy and paste the provided Python code into the code editor in the "Python code" tab.
- After pasting the code, you can run it to see Reeborg navigate through the maze, following the specified instructions.
- This allows you to interact with and observe the "Escaping the Maze" scenario using Python code on the Reeborg's World platform.

# Project 7 : Hangman
The Hangman game in Python is a word-guessing game where players attempt to discover a hidden word by suggesting letters. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn, and players aim to guess the word before the entire figure is completed.
